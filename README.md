# smart-rag-chatbot
This is a production-ready chatbot system designed for SaaS platforms. It uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 API with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to respond with contextual knowledge. If no info is found, it fetches answers from external APIs. When both fail, it escalates to human support.
